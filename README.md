This project uses the following dependencies:

There are two routes setup, '/categories' and '/businesses', there categories simply returns a predefined list of categories for the search by category feature. 

The businesses route can search multiple businesses or a single business depending on the nature of the request. 

All requests are made through an instance of yelp-fusion and use the yelp.client predefined methods.
